# Project Title : Credit Card Fraud detection

# Project Overview
Credit card fraud is a major issue in the banking and finance sector, as it involves the use of stolen or illegally obtained credit cards for fraudulent activities. The US Federal Trade Commission estimated that the amount of money lost to credit card fraud in the US alone was $8.6 billion in 2018. This highlights the need for effective fraud detection systems to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions. 

# Objective
To determine what features are most useful in predicting fraudulent credit card transactions? To identify what machine learning models are best suited for predicting fraudulent credit card transactions. To identify which machine learning model provides the best accuracy in predicting fraudulent credit card transactions.
