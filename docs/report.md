# Project Title : Credit Card Fraud detection

# Introduction
Credit card fraud is a major issue in the banking and finance sector, as it involves the use of stolen or illegally obtained credit cards for fraudulent activities. The US Federal Trade Commission estimated that the amount of money lost to credit card fraud in the US alone was $8.6 billion in 2018. This highlights the need for effective fraud detection systems to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions. This report will provide a critical evaluation of the fraud detection systems currently in use in banking and finance. The report will assess the current fraud detection systems in terms of their effectiveness, accuracy and scalability, in order to identify areas for improvement.

# Objective
To determine what features are most useful in predicting fraudulent credit card transactions? To identify what machine learning models are best suited for predicting fraudulent credit card transactions. To identify which machine learning model provides the best accuracy in predicting fraudulent credit card transactions.

# Motivation
This issue is important because credit card fraud is a major issue for banks and credit card companies, resulting in billions of dollars in losses each year. Understanding the factors that contribute to fraudulent transactions is key to preventing and minimizing fraud. By analyzing the data, it is possible to identify patterns that can be used to create more effective fraud detection methods and reduce losses.

# Data collection
The data used for this project will be a dataset from the Kaggle platform, which contains credit card transaction information from a bank in Europe. The dataset contains more than 30000 observations, 122 attributes. The target variable is labeled as either 1 for customer with payment issues or difficulties and 0 otherwise. This will be used to illustrate fraud or non-fraud transaction. The data is of poor quality and needs to be cleaned before any analysis is done. The source of data is reliable.

Final dataset provides a comprehensive view of all the information gathered from the data

# Exploratory Data Analysis

- A histogram of the AMT_CREDIT variable in the dataset using the hist function from the matplotlib library. The histogram is created with 20 bins and black edges around each bin. The title function is used to add a title to the plot. The resulting histogram is displayed using the show function.
